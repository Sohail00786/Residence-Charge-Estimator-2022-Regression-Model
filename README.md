## Problem Statement
- Lots of people migartes to new cities to make there professional and educational career and want to have residence not far away from there workplace and college.This Model will help them to figured out rent based on Locality they wants to acquire,model includes major cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Bangalore.

- When i was on college i have also faced this issue while hunting residence and due to lack of information of that particular area resulted me to pay ₹ 1500 extra for the property which we have acquired for rent.

## Project Overview
- Designed a Machine Learning Regression Model which is focused on charge of residence

- Main aim of this estimator is to display residence charge based on city, locality and residence features.

## The models were evaluated on the basis of three metrics

- R2score - 92.7%
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error

## The models tried out in this project are

1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Elastic Net Regression
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression
7. Adaboost Regression
8. Gradient Boost Regression
9. XGBoost Regression


## Approach:

- The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.


## Setup
#### Step - 1 Install the Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step - 2 Run app.py file
